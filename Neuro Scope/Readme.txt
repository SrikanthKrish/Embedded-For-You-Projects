Neuro Scope

The NEURO-SCOPE is an instrument which is used to detect stress level of various organs in our body. 

NEUROSCOPE is based on Galvanic skin response (GSR) technique ,in this technique Skin Conductance (SC) 
is calculated which is a measure of the skin's ability to conduct electricity.

Atiny electrical voltage (so small, that it is not felt) is applied through the two electrodes, 
usually strapped to the two fingers of one hand, in order to establish an electric circuit where 
the client becomes a variable resistor. The real time variation in conductance, which is the inverse 
of the resistance (an alternative measure of the Galvanic Skin Response), is calculated. Clinically, 
changes in SC reflect changes in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. 

As a person becomes more or less stressed, the skin's conductance increases or decreases proportionally.


Features

The Atmel ATMega8 is the most efficient high performance, low power 8-bit RISC microcontroller that offers the following main features used in this project.

    * 16x2 LCD Display.
    * Supply voltage : +12V, 600mA` from battery emulator.
    * Power ON Reset.
    * Expansion connector for connecting probe.
    * Constant Current circuit.
    * Alarm LED.

Software Features :

    * Auto calibration :  button, to calibrate points on different body parts (ears, palms, feet etc.)
    * Manual calibration : Sensitivity increase and decrease button for practioners .To manually  Calibrate the instrument.
    * Audio Indication : Unique three-stage audio indication for point detection: SILENT when the probe is  far  away  from  the  points, INTERMITTENT  sound  when  the probe  is  close  to  a  point  and CONTINUOUS sound when the probe is on the point.
    * Mute Button : to turn off the Sound of Audio indication.
    * Bar-Graph : display of LED's for displaying the sensitivity of the point with respect to its surroundings.







Connection - Neuro Scope


Power Connections

2) Connect DC Power Jack to DC socket.
3) Conenct Red wire to 8 V - 12 V DC voltage from your power supply or battery.
4) Connect Balack wire to ground of your power supply or battery.

Probe Connection

5) As shown in the diagram. Connect Detector probe to 'PD' and Ground probe to 'GD' terminals.


Operation

6) Your LCD will Show Initialing screen and model nuber of Neuro Scope.

7) As explained in the features Neuro scope can work in Auto/Manual Calibration mode.

8) Use Auto/ Maunal button to toggle between the two caliberation modes.

9) Auto Mode - When in auto made Neuro Scope will auto calibrate itself.

Steps :

   	a)Place ground probe in one hand of the patient.
	b)Use Detector probe to detect point which have minimum conductivity readings.
	c)Now press UP/DOWN button to start auto calibration feature.
	d)For the next 2 Minutes slowly moe the detector probe near the pressure points.
	e)Lcd will show following message.
	
	1st Row - Calibration ..
	2nd Row - XXXX ( Conductivity Reading)

	f)Once the Calibration is over LCD will show following message.
	
	1st Row - POINT: XX.XX % (Conductivity Value in percentage)
	2nd Row - LIMIT: XX %    (Limit is Alarm Limit)

	g)Now move the Detector probe slowly near to reference points in the calibratio region.
	h)Conductivity of a particulatr point is show agains the 'POINT' reading on the 1st row.
	i)As you mode the detector probe the reading will start to change.
	j)Reading will be maximum where there is minimum conductivity.Now you can mark this point with a pen.
	k)Also Mute button can be used to display an Alram in form of a LED If  ('POINT' % > 'LIMIT%')
	
10) Manual Mode - When in manual mode user has to himself control the senstivity and limit values

	a)Use Up/Down keys to change the limit values.

11) Please remember 'AUTO' calibration has to be done each time you have to Detect points on different body organ.
Because skin senstivity for every organ is different.



Revision 1.0

Constant Circuit has been modified.The new kit comes with modified constant current circuit.
