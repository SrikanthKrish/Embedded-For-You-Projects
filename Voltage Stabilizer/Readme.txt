Voltage stabilizers, are used to regulate the voltage on AC power distribution lines or before electrical appliances at point-of-use. These regulators operate by using an Electronic Tap Changing Solid State Design to select the appropriate tap on an auto transformer with multiple taps, or by using an Electronic Servo / Electro - Mechanical Design comprising of a motor driven variable transformer.

In Automatic voltage stabilizer an Auto - Wound type transformer is used. Functioning of Automatic Voltage stabilizer is divided into four parts.

    * Input Monitoring.
    * Selection of Appropriate Tapping.
    * Voltage Interruption Protection.
    * Over Temperature protection.
