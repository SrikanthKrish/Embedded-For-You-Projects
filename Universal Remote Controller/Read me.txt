A universal remote is a remote control that can be programmed to operate various 
consumer electronic devices of different brands. Low-end universal remotes can only
 control a set number of devices determined by their manufacturer, 
while mid- and high-end universal remotes allow the user to program in new control codes to the remote.

A universal remote control allows the user to control various consumer electronic products by programming new control codes to each switch of the remote. It has following features. 

    * IR receiver (TSOP1838).
    * IR transmitter.
    * PC Connectivity using RS 232.
    * Separate LEDs for status of Rx and Tx.
    * Timer/Counter2 8-bit Timer in compare output mode.
    * Timer/Counter1 16-bit Timer in Interrupt capture mode.
    * Programmable Serial USART.
    * 23 Programmable I/O Lines.

Software Features :

    * Programmable via external remote signal.
    * 9 Keys/memory for storage of signal received.
    * Can work as RC5 Receiver or RC5 Transmitter.
    * PC connectivity to display decoded RC5 signal.
    * Synchronization Led.


Operation

Universal Remote controller kit can be used to Recieve Infrared codes and store them.
Please note Either Universal remote controller can work as a Transmitter or a Reciever.

Seperate Demo codes to recieve the Code over Serial RS232 are written in IR remote control directoty.
The code are Open source from www.arduini.cc community and distributed to you under LGPL licence.

IRrecvDemo - IR reciever Demo


Serial Connection - PC

1) Connect Serial cable to PC.
2) Set COM port baudrate to 9600 (8-1-N).



Power Connections

3) Connect DC Power Jack to DC socket.
4) Conenct Red wire to 8 V - 12 V DC voltage from your power supply or battery.
5) Connect Balack wire to ground of your power supply or battery.

Hardware Test

6) After power on and connecting your PC through serial cable to kit.
Open Hyper Terminal Software on your computer.

On Windowsd XP - Go to Start Menu -  Accessories - Hyper Terminal
On Windows 7 - You will have to install the software. 
Goto /Software folder and install serial-monitor.exe.


7)Once your connections are made you will see.Following message on your Hyper terminal software screen.

Embedded For You - Universal Remote Controller (Reciever) 

8) Copy ../IRremote folder inside /arduino0021/libraries folder. ( Library Installation)

9) Go to /examples/IRrecvDemo and open IRrecvDemo.pde .

10) Press Remote Keys against the IR Reciever marked in the Setup_diagram.gif file.LED mounted besides the IR module
will blink as an when the data is recieved. 


11) Use your remote to press 1,2,3 and switches.

12) Open Serial_sample.txt file.This is the sample of Serial data recieved over RS232 protocol.

13) For example you recieve Code - '1FE50AF' when key 1 is pressed in remote.

14) Store this code and use IR Transmitter to send to code back using IRsendDemo.

InfraRed Send Demo

Hardware Description

Keys are Implemented on Analog Pin AD0 and AD1.When no key is pressed the defauilt voltage is 5.0 on each ADC.
Keys are detected by change in voltage on the particular ADC.

Pin Description

Keys S4,S7,S8,S9    are on AD0
Keys S1,S2,S3,S5,S6 are on AD1

15) Go to /examples/IRSendDemo and open IRSendDemo.pde.

16) Voltage output of each pin is defined in the routine.

#define S1 439//1
#define S2 1583//1
#define S3 2492//1
#define S4 894 //0
#define S5 3660//1
#define S6 //1
#define S7 1778//0
#define S8 2995//0
#define S9 3855//0

17) When we press a particluar kit get_key fuinction returns its particluar number.

18) Next we use simple Switch/case routine to send the corresponding codes whcih we obtained from IRRecvdemo.pde.

19) Youi wil notice irsend.sendNEC(Code, Number of bits ) function.
The 'code' is a hexadeciombnal value which denotes the IR code which is to be send and 'Number of Bits' denote the length of the code.

20) Use IRtest.pde to determine the Type of remote and length of IR signal recieved.
