{"name":"Embedded-for-you-projects","body":"### Microcontroller Applications that you will love to make\r\n\r\n## What is this about ?\r\n\r\nThe Current Directory contains some of the Microcontroller Projects that are made on Atmel 8-bit RISC devices.\r\nSince 2002 we have made over 300 designs and published 40 of the most Interesting designs in [Embedded For You Magazine](www.embedded4u.com).\r\n\r\nSome these designs are conceptualized form of Embedded Applications that we see our day-to-day life.\r\nlike Automatic Voltage Stabilizers , Hot Water Controller, Water Tank Controller, Solar Battery Charger , Auto Tap controller , Automatic Curtain Controller and more..\r\n\r\nSome of the following Microcontroller Projects designs are now converted to open source projects..\r\n\r\n1. Music MIMIC - 5 X 5 LED matrix with Music Karaoke device\r\n\r\n2. Mechatronics Trainer - Arduino MotorSheild with PS2 mouse/kbd and Sensors like IR, LDR and Temp.\r\n\r\n3. Capsense - For prototyping Capsense PCB for touch button applications with AC Power Control Circuitr.\r\n\r\n4. Universal Remote Controller -IR Transmitter and Receiver with 4x4 Keypad ,LCD and RS232.\r\n\r\n5. Voltage Stabilizer\r\n\r\nTo see more about our company and products logon to [www.aet-embedtech.com](www.aet-embedtech.com).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill update more as I get time.\r\nCircuits ,Schematics and PCB of the Designs are available on request.","tagline":"Embedded For You Magazine Microcontroller Projects","google":"<script type=\"text/javascript\">    var _gaq = _gaq || [];   _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-17601077-6']);   _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);    (function() {     var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;     ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
