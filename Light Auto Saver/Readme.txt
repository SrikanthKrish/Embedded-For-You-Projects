Light AutoSaver uses Atmel ATTiny13 microcontroller, a high performance, low power, 8-bit Microcontroller, that offers the following main feature used in the project :

    * Expansion Connector of Load and Mains output.
    * Optocoupler used V138T.
    * TRIAC used BTA12-600B.
    * One 8-bit Timer/Counter with Prescaler
    * Two PWM Channels.
    * 4-channel, 10-bit ADC with Internal Voltage Reference.
    * 8-pin PDIP / SOIC: Six Programmable I/O Lines.
    * External interrupt source.
    * Power ON Reset.

Software Features :

There are three operating modes in light auto saver.

Manual Mode : The user will have to switch ON / OFF the light manually.

Semi-Automatic Mode : Manual choice of reference illuminance level or moods :

    * Study Room For high illuminance level as required in a study room.
    * Living Room For moderate illuminance required in day-to-day living.
    * Night Lamp For low illuminance, to be used as a night lamp. 

Fully Automatic mode : Automatic dimming light control (photocell controlled continuous dimming with 550 lux target illuminance). 
In this mode, the photocell detects the level of day-light illumination in room and adjusts the light intensity accordingly, thus saving a lot of energy.
A radical feature of this application is it saves approximately 30% energy, during while maintaining the same brightness level of a lighting device, thus reducing your electricity bills by drastic amounts.

Operation

Light Auto Saver


1) Connect the mains lead recieved with the box to mains connector(N-L).
2) Connect your load upto 60W between (N-L) on load connector.

Semi Auto Mode

3) Press Mood Button to Switch on and Off the bulb.
4) In semi atuomatic mode as exlained above, user can control the power to Load.
5) One the Bulb/Device is powered on using Mood button, use Mode button to increase/decreas the Power of device.
6) Mood button can be again used to Power On/Off the device on same intensity as changed earlier using mode button.

Manual

1) In Manual mode button is used to power On/Off the bulb.As Said earlier even in this mode user can save upto 30% of energy.
